Startup project - Reddit
Problem Statement: Online discussions are often an information-overload and is inefficient to read through the entire conversation chain to understand the key points. 

Users post anonymously on discussion boards, grouped under various communities/topics.

A minimalist Reddit-style forum where users post links, images, or discussions but with an AI sidebar or summary bubble that:
- Summarizes the top post and comments.
- Highlights major viewpoints or debates.

Interface:
- Homepage displays popular/recommend posts
- Users can search specific question or community page
- Community page: users can create new posts or browse existing ones

Infrastructure:
- Frontend: React (Next.js) 
- Backend: Postgres + Auth
